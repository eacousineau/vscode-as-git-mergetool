# VS Code as Git Mergetool

</div>

This extension provides diff editor layouts for 3-way merges
directly in VS Code.

[Demo screencast](./media/unpackaged/demo.mp4)

## Features

- Assists in setting up suitable Git and VS Code configuration options,
  which allows that VS Code is invoked
  when an external `git mergetool` is executed.
- Shows a 3- or 4-pane diff layout when VS Code opens a merge situation.
- Synchronizes the scroll position of the files according to a text diff.
- Provides commands for launching/continuing/stopping `git mergetool`.
- Optionally opens the Git commit message in an editor
  after a successful `git mergetool` execution
  (as a workaround for few Git extension bugs).
- Allows to select arbitrary files for merging,
  invoking `git merge-files` and the diff layout.
- Provides a command for `git merge --abort` and `git merge --quit`.

At time of release this has been tested only on my Linux machine,
so especially Windows and MacOS users are welcomed
to report any compatibility issues. See [Contribute](#Contribute).

## Installation

- Go to the
  [latest Release](https://github.com/zawys/vscode-as-git-mergetool/releases/latest)
  and download the VSIX.
- Skip this if you do not want to verify the signature:
  - Download the other files into the same directory.
  - `sha256sum -c SHA256SUMS`
  - `gpg --recv-keys '4A5D 4A5F B953 7A3A B931 6463 41B3 FBF3 7F23 3754'`
  - `gpg --verify SHA256SUMS.sig SHA256SUMS`
- Run the command ‚ÄúInstall from VSIX‚Ä¶‚Äù inside VS Code and select the VSIX.

Currently, the extension is not available on the Visual Studio Marketplace,
but that will hopefully change in a few days.

## Usage

When you have a merge conflict in an opened repo,
you can run the command ‚ÄúStart `git mergetool`‚Äù from the command palette
or the command menu in the SCM panel.
Then the layout should change and new buttons in the status bar should appear.

When you start `git mergetool` from the command line,
that process is not controlled by the extension
but still a diff layout in VS Code should open.

## Layout

The default layout `4TransferRight` has 4 panes
showing the changes distributed over two dimensions:

- Top vs. bottom panes: local vs. remote changes
- Left vs. right panes: changes applied starting from base vs. ending in merged

In the right panes you can edit the (same) merged file
and the goal of the game is to make the right side
semantically equal the left side. üòÖ

There is also a 3-column layout available.

## Known issues

- When you have an file with conflicts opened,
  start a diff layout for that file and stop the diff layout,
  then it may happen that the originally opened editor is closed
  and a diff editor remains instead.
  This is due to a limitation of VS Code that editors seem to be recreated
  when previously covered by other editors and
  then there is no reliable way to find out who the editor belongs to.

  **TL;DR**: Use the command ‚ÄúDeactivate diff layout‚Äù,
  ‚ÄúStop mergetool‚Äù or `Ctrl+W`
  to stop the diff editor layout.
  Auto save is useful, too.

## Build

1. [Install Yarn globally](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install)
2. `yarn`
3. `yarn run build`

   The generated VSIX should then be in `packages/`.
